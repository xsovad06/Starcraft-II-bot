# AI Development for StarCraft II

Welcome to the exciting journey of programming artificial intelligence for [StarCraft II](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/), the popular real-time strategy game. 
StarCraft II is free-to-play and available on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, making it accessible for AI enthusiasts and developers across different operating systems.

## Resources for Learning and Inspiration

As you embark on this adventure, here are some valuable resources to kickstart your AI project:

- The **Python-based StarCraft II Client** for AI development is an excellent starting point: Check out the repository at [BurnySc2/python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) for comprehensive guides and a plethora of [examples](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/tree/develop/examples) to learn from.

- DeepMind's groundbreaking work on AI with their article, [AlphaStar: Mastering the real-time strategy game StarCraft II](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/), offers an in-depth look at how they trained a neural network to play StarCraft II at a high level.

- Explore AI tournaments, such as the ones hosted by the University of Olomouc, for a practical glimpse into competitive AI gameplay: [UPOL SC2 AI Cup](https://www.inf.upol.cz/sc2-ai-cup/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

Follow these steps to prepare your development environment:

### Create Python project
1. **Download the Project Starter Kit**: Access the project template to get started with a sample AI bot. Download Link: [Starter Project Kit](https://akela.mendelu.cz/~xkoloma1/ai/cv_07.zip)


2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**: Ensure that you have a clean workspace for your AI's development by creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary libraries.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies from the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Map Configuration for Bot Testing

To effectively test our AI bots, we will be using a simplified version of the game on a custom map named "Distributer." This map provides a controlled environment that is ideal for AI development and testing.

- **Downloading the Map**: Obtain the Distributer map from the following resource: [2022 - Agria Valley](https://www.inf.upol.cz/sc2-ai-cup/map/sc2-ai-cup-2022.SC2Map).

- **Installing the Map**: Once downloaded, the map file must be placed into the `Maps` directory of your StarCraft II installation. The default path on most systems is `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Maps`.

### Running a Demo Bot
To see a StarCraft II AI bot in action:

Execute the script WorkerRushBot.py in your preferred IDE or command line interface.
```bash
python WorkerRushBot.py
```

### Additional Notes on Visual Studio Code Setup
For those who prefer using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as their IDE, here's a brief guide to get your project up and running:

1. **Open VSCode** and navigate to the cloned/downloaded project directory.
2. **Open a terminal in VSCode** (usually `Ctrl + `` or through the Terminal menu).
3. **Follow the steps outlined in 'Setting Up Your Environment'** to create your virtual environment and install dependencies directly within the VSCode terminal.
4. **Run your** bot by right-clicking on _WorkerRushBot.py_ and selecting **'Run Python File in Terminal'** or by using the terminal command mentioned above.

By following these instructions, you'll have a functioning AI bot for StarCraft II ready for development and experimentation in no time. 
Dive into the provided resources, get inspired, and start crafting your AI!
